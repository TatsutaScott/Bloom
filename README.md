# Bloom

Bloom is a generative art piece that builds on the long standing history of the use of fractals in generative art. However, while many fractals are celebrated for their seamless, polished surfaces, Bloom intentionally embraces a noisier, unrefined texture, where each plotted pixel is visible and deliberate.

Showing the fractal being drawn point by point, the work invites the viewer to witness the emergence of order from chaos, to observe how a system, governed by simple rules, can lead to the creation of unexpected beauty. In Bloom, beauty is not only found in the completed image, but in the process of creation itself, where through the transformation of a single point a form emerges. Through this, the piece invites reflection on the nature of systems, individuality, and the continuous dance between chaos and order.

## Running the program

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

A deployed version of the project can also be accessed here: https://in-bloom.vercel.app/

The program can be run in a normal or display mode. The normal mode is primarily used to generate images, but it can be switched into a display mode which will continually generate images at a slightly slower rate, randomizing settings after they fully develop.
