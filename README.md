# Bloom

*Bloom* is a one of the first creative codign projects I worked on while I was learning p5. Based on [Scott Draves paper on fractal flames](https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf), *bloom* generates images by randomly picked 2 different iterated function systems, a color palette and a randomly weighted set of warping functions. It's pretty janky compared to Draves' actual fractal flame implementation since it doesn't include things like the log density display, but tbh who cares it looks noisier and that's cool.
